                <li>Write code for others.</li>
                <li>Don't be clever. Be clear.</li>
                <li>The best code to maintain is the one never written.</li>
                <li>Writing new features is fun. Maintaining them is the work.</li>
                <li>Solve the problem behind the feature.</li>
                <li>Don't optimize prematurely.</li>
                <li>When implementing: first make it work, then make it fast, then make it beautiful.</li>
                <li>The choice of programming language is secondary to the development.</li>
                <li>Knowledge further down in the stack gives me more leverage higher up.</li>
                <li>If you can't explain something to others, you probably don't understand it properly yourself.</li>
                <li>If you can do it on a single machine, do it on a single machine.</li>
                <li>
                    Technical debt can be classified into three main types.
